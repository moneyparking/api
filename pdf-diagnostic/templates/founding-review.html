  <!-- SIGNAL ANALYSIS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Signal Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      The project demonstrates early validation of market demand,
      supported by consistent revenue inflow and repeat customers.
      However, current growth dynamics suggest execution-driven constraints
      rather than pure market limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most significant risk factors are linked to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Customer acquisition efficiency</li>
      <li>Revenue concentration across a limited client base</li>
      <li>Operational scalability beyond current revenue levels</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- VERDICT -->
  <section class="section verdict">
    <h2>Summary Verdict</h2>

    <p>
      Based on the observed financial and operational signals,
      the project can be classified as <strong>conditionally viable</strong>
      at its current stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Short-term sustainability appears achievable under controlled growth.
      Medium-term scaling will require structural improvements in distribution
      strategy and internal processes.
    </p>
